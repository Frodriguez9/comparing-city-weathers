# comparing-city-weathers

A program that compares weather values for two different
locations on earth.

## THE PORPUSE OF THE PROGRAM IS TO DEMONSTRATE MY ABILITY TO:

- Use APIs
- Read and manipulate JSON data
- Handle errors. e.g: Failure to connect to API server.
- Build data frames

## Disclosure:
When running the program, sometimes the server takes a while to respond. Be patient :)
